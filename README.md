# Supeep's Neovim Configuration

It's my first time configuring a software.For this configuration I learned a lot. It's not perfect,but it's functional.

I've spend two days for this config.I'm a bit tired,but i'm happy now. It successfully ran on Ubuntu,not pretty well for windows,but it's ok ,i have VSCode for windows.

When facing network issues with nvim-treesitter and finding a solution on github someone shared a year age,i experienced the warmth of the open-source community for the first time.

Hope I can be a good programmer :)
